# ImageMeta

Hosted on a subdomain of my site: [imagemeta.aaroncunliffe.dev](https://imagemeta.aaroncunliffe.dev)

This is the site that demos my **image-meta-js** npm package: [github](https://github.com/aaroncunliffe/image-meta-js), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/image-meta-js).

Just a very basic site that shows off some of the functionality of the library. Images can be uploaded or submitted via a URL, the metadata is parsed parsed directly in the browser and displayed in a clean, human readable format.
